My project is called virtual data analysis training platform. this platform helps in specialising yourself in data analysis. it consists of workshops where the user chooses which workshop she 
needs to learn well about a specific course she wants and we have resources you can refer yourself to when learning so you can know more about the workshop you are attending.we also have 
experts in those workshop who helps students as instructors so that they can learn from the best to make their dream career more valid for the outside world.
So the way this platform works the user opens it and see what we do our services,our workshops and everything and then if they are interested they sign up and they choose whether they are 
signing in as a new instructor or a new student, and then they create an account and they join the team. There they find tabs like home which shows which courses we give and some tesmonials
or feedback from our previous students,and then there is services which shows the kind of services we offer,and then about us briefly describes us and a short biography of our platform and when
we started our vision and some of our team members,there is also the attendee tab which shows who attended,there is also instructors tab which shows our expert instructors,there is also where 
they can find the resources they can use while studying,where they can access the workshops available and lastly the supervisor tab.
all in all our platform is best for preparing well those who want to expertise themselves in data analysis.
